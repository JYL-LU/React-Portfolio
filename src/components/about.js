        <p>
          After 10+ years of successful career in the architecture industry I
          decided to make a switch to software engineering. I graduated from UC
          Berkeley Computer Coding Boot Camp 2021 and am looking for an
          internship position as a SWE.
        </p>
        <p>
          From my previous career path I bring deep experience in coordination,
          team building, cross-team communication, strategic thinking and
          business alignment. As a Software Engineer I'm comfortable with
          JavaScript and SQL and I have strong fundamentals in data structures,
          algorithms, modularity, and abstraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm passionate about multicultural organizations, North American and
          Asian markets, highly dynamic work environments, collaboration and
          team work.
